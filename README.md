# Welcome to the page for our kNN Script

This script was made to map a set of test cells to their k nearest neighbors in a set of atlas cells. Particularly, this script was meant to take CyTOF data and FCS files as input.


When using the script, there is a defined section called "user input" where the user should input the PATH to the files that the user is trying to run kNN on.
